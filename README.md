# Inspiration
I'm a creative type with more ideas than time to execute them. I love the elegance of keeping code to a minimum. Even though I'm technical and do my fair share of coding, I wanted to enable my creative peers to create more effortlessly.

# What it does
Creyex empowers non-technical creatives to effortlessly generate websites, minigames, landing pages, resumes, and more using AI. It provides guides created by tech experts, enabling creatives to bring ideas to life without coding.

# How we built it
For the build, we used a simple Express + MongoDB + Auth + Bootstrap boilerplate along with lots and lots of AI-generated code. This combination allowed us to bring our vision to life in the form of this MVP.

# Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges was knowing where to start. Once we structured our thoughts for the first time, everything went well. Managing our time and prioritizing tasks to ensure the project stayed on track was crucial.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud to have created a platform that bridges the gap between technical and non-technical creatives. Our MVP showcases the potential of AI in democratizing creativity and making advanced tools accessible to everyone.

# What we learned
Through this project, we learned the importance of ruthlessly prioritizing and having a good boilerplate. Extensive work with prompt engineering over the past year gave us a clear vision of what's possible and allowed us to test various ideas effectively.

# What's next for Creyex
I have a fair backlog of features and security checks I want to implement in the hopes of getting Creyex into production ASAP. Eager to foster a small number of creative users to drive the product with feedback and grow it organically into its full potential.
